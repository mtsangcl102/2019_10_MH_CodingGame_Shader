Hi guys, welcome to learn Lua and using for HotFix in Unity.
We would use xLua this time which is a open source plugin from Tencent

There are few things to do:
- Download xLua from https://github.com/Tencent/xLua and setup on Unity Project
- Learn about xLua and how to use Lua call C# and vice versa through xLua documents
- Download "Question" folder and put it under "Assets"
- Finish missing code of "xLuaTest.cs"
- Finish 2 lua script "TestLuaHotFix.lua.txt" && "TestImplement.lua.txt"
- Open "xLuaTestSence" and press GUI button "Reload Lua Text" to run all case

Remarks:
- Remember set up hotfix setting before run code
- "xLuaTest.cs" already have "TODO" region, other code should not be changed
- Examples of xLua are very useful to learn how to us lua
- Do not wirte Lua script as string in C# script directly
- after modify "~.lua.txt", no need to re-play unity, press GUI button "Reload Lua Text" is fine
- Feel free to ask

Expected Result:
- Console will show "Case X : pass" and no error
