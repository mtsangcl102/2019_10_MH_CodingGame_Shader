# 2019_10_MH_CodingGame_Shader

Hi guys, welcome back to coding game.
We are going to learn Shader on Unity.

This time, we are going to finish 3 things:
1. Create a simple surface shader (Shader_1) to make cut off effect just like Shader_Demo_1.mp4

2. Create a vertex and fragment shader (Shader_2) and do the same cut off effect 

3. Write 2 more passes in Shader_2 to handle 2 lightings that make effect like VandFShader_Demo_2

You can find any source from internet and there is no model answer.
In the videos, the rock have some write object looks like snow, if you want to do that, just follow this link and it is very easy
