# 2019_10_MH_CodingGame_Shader

Hi guys, welcome back to coding game.
We are going to learn Shader on Unity.

This time, we are going to finish 3 things:
1. Create a simple surface shader (Shader_1) to make cut off effect just like Shader_Demo_1.mp4
- Cut off effect, cut off surface change over time, DO NOT use C# script
- Edge Color, color is keep changing and handle via shader, not C# script

2. Create a vertex and fragment shader (Shader_2) and do the same cut off effect 
- Just like Shader_1, but use Vertex and Fragment Shader

3. Write 2 more passes in Shader_2 to handle 2 lightings that make effect like VandFShader_Demo_2
- Add two lighting, position is no matter
- Lighting Type as "Directional" and use C# script to keep rotate one of that

You can find any source from internet and there is no model answer.
